## About me

Hi, I am [**Amit Shekhar**](https://amitshekhar.me), I have mentored many developers, and their efforts landed them high-paying tech jobs, helped many tech companies in solving their unique problems, and created many open-source libraries being used by top companies. I am passionate about sharing knowledge through open-source, blogs, and videos.

## [My Personal Blog - amitshekhar.me](https://amitshekhar.me/blog) - High-quality content to learn Android concepts.

## We will build and learn the following for the App like Uber and Lyft:
* Create Rider Android Clone App
* Fetch and show nearby cabs on Google Map
* Set Pickup and drop location
* Book a cab
* Fetch and show driver current location
* Show pickup and trip path on Map with Animation
* Cab Arrival for a pickup like Uber
* On-going trip UI
* Trip End
* Animation like Uber App for Moving Car
* Just to make it simple. This project uses the basic MVP Architecture for building the Uber and Lyft clone
* We have simulated the WebSocket API for you 

## We have simulated the backend environment for you to get the real-work like experience.

## Building the project
* Every feature is done in a different branch so that it will be easy to follow.
* Clone the project, the `master` branch has the latest code.
* To learn and implement from the beginning, switch the branch to `base-project`
* This App uses the Google API Key for Maps, Directions, and Places. Get the API key from the Google Cloud Developer console after enabling the Maps, Directions and Places features for your project. Refer this [link](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/get-api-key). And put that key in the local.properties file in your project:
Your local.properties will like below:
```
sdk.dir=PATH_TO_ANDROID_SDK_ON_YOUR_LOCAL_MACHINE    
apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY
```
* Start implementing features:
   * Start with the `base-project` branch
   * Setup project with basic MVP Architecture.
   * Implement Permission for fetching current location.
   * Implement feature - nearby cabs.
   * Use WebSocket present in `simulator` module to fetch the nearby cabs.
   * Match your solution with `nearby-cabs` branch.
   * Implement feature - pickup and drop location.
   * Match your solution with `pickup-drop-location` branch.
   * Implement feature - book a cab.
   * Implement feature - Show pickup path on the map with Animation.
   * Implement feature - Show the current driver location during pickup.
   * Implement feature - Cab is arriving and arrived.
   * Implement feature - Car Animation like Uber.
   * Implement feature - Show trip path on the map with Animation.
   * Implement feature - Trip Starts.
   * Implement feature - Show the current driver location during the trip.
   * Implement feature - Trip on-going.
   * Implement feature - Trip Ends.
   * Implement feature - Implement Take Next Ride.
   * Match your solution with `book-complete-trip` branch.

## WebSocket API Reference for this project
A WebSocket is a persistent connection between a client and server. WebSockets provide a bidirectional, full-duplex communications channel that operates over HTTP through a single TCP/IP socket connection. At its core, the WebSocket protocol facilitates message passing between a client and server. In our case, we have simulated it for you.

* In WebSocket, we have three methods:
   * `connect()`: To connect with the server
   * `sendMessage(data: String)`: To send the data to the server
   * `disconnect()`: To disconnect from the server

* In WebSocketListener, we have four callbacks:
   * `onConnect()`: Called when it is connected with the server
   * `onMessage(data: String)`: Called when an event comes from the server
   * `fun onDisconnect()`: Called when the client is disconnected from the server
   * `fun onError(error: String)`:  Called when the error occurred on the server

* Client sending event to server using `webSocket.sendMessage(data)`:
    * Request for nearby cabs from server
    ```json
    {
      "type": "nearByCabs",
      "lat": 28.438147,
      "lng": 77.0994446
    }
    ``` 
   * Request a cab from server
    ```json
    {
      "type": "requestCab",
      "pickUpLat": 28.4369353,
      "pickUpLng": 77.1125599,
      "dropLat": -25.274398,
      "dropLng": 133.775136
    }
    ```
  
* The Server sending success event to the client received in `onMessage(data: String)`:
   * NearBy cabs 
    ```json
    {
      "type": "nearByCabs",
      "locations": [
