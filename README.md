## Building the project
* Every feature is done in a different branch so that it will be easy to follow.
* Clone the project, the `master` branch have the latest code.
* To learn and implement from beginning, switch the branch to `base-project`
* This App uses the Google API Key for Maps, Directions, and Places. Get the API key from the Google Cloud Developer console after enabling the Maps, Directions and Places features for your project and put that in the local.properties:
```apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY```. Refer this [link](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/get-api-key)
* Start implementing features:
   * Start with the `base-project` branch
   * Setup project with basic MVP Architecture.
   * Implement Permission for fetching current location.
   * Implement Nearby cabs feature.
   * Use WebSocket present in simulator module to fetch nearby cabs.
   * Match your solution with `nearby-cabs` branch.
